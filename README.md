## Motivation
I chose this dataset because my family has had multiple encounters with cancer, and I wanted to understand the current state of cancer in Germany, especially breast cancer. By analyzing this dataset, we can gain insights into how cancer affects the German population and its importance as a cause of mortality.

## Project Description
The project will investigate questions concerning cancer as a cause of death in Germany, with a focus on breast cancer mortality among women:

-  What percentage of all deaths in Germany in 2022 were due to cancer, and how does this compare to other leading causes of death? 
-  Among the various types of cancer, which had the highest mortality rates in 2022, and how do these rates differ between men and women? 
-  How have breast cancer mortality rates changed over the last 20 years among women? 
-  How does breast cancer mortality vary across different age groups in women in 2022? 
-  What is the average age at which women die to breast cancer in 2022?


## Installation Instructions
Download the repository and ensure Python, matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn are installed. The code is tested with Python 3.11.4, and compatibility with other versions cannot be guaranteed.

## Usage Guide
The program includes a Jupyter notebook that can be opened using an appropriate editor.

## Data Source
The dataset originates from the GENESIS platform, a joint statistical information system operated by Germany's federal and state statistical offices. 

The selected dataset ["Causes of death statistics - Deaths: Germany, years, causes of deaths, age groups" (Tabelle 23211-0004)](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis//online?operation=table&code=23211-0004&bypass=true&levelindex=1&levelid=1714304169630#abreadcrumb) provides comprehensive data on deaths in Germany by cause, including various types of cancer, like breast cancer, along with data on sex and age, spanning the past two decades from 2003 to 2022.
